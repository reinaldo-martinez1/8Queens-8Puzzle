# 8Queens-8Puzzle

The assignment aimed to evaluate the performance of different local search algorithms in solving two classic AI problems: the 8-puzzle and the 8-queens problem. The primary objective was to measure the search cost and the percentage of solved problems for each algorithm across many instances. Four algorithms were evaluated: Hill Climbing (Steepest-Ascent and First-Choice variants), Hill Climbing with Random Restart, and Simulated Annealing.
